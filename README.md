# apimountain
an unofficial build week idea proposed by TL group members.  Will allow users to add a public api that they like, and give people the option to upvote and sort by likes


OVERALL : 

- Single Page? Nav Bar will be only for login and posting new api entries. 

Api Mountain will have a login system connected to a firestore database. This will  include admin functions as well.

Non User experience :
non users will be able to visit the website and search APIs and *maybe* be able to upvote them. 

Logged In User experience : 
Logged in users will be able to submit an API and be able to upvote.

Users will be asked for login info:
-Email
-PassWord
-Username
-Bio
- 
Admin User experience: 
Admin users will have the ability to delete apis and to edit them hopefully from the front end. 
Admins will have the ability to make another email address an admin as well. 
Admins will not have the ability to delete user accounts. 


** STRETCH ** 
Give users the ability to down vote, 
-Sort APIs by downvote


Give users the ability to have a personal top 10 favorite APIs.
- Possibly under an accounts details kind of modal? They can save the name or address under their account name, or at least link its collection to their username.
